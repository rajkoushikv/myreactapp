         <text>A new study has found that regular exercise can be an effective way to combat depression, with participants experiencing a significant reduction in symptoms after just six weeks of exercise.</text>
      </summary>
      <body>The study, conducted by researchers at a university in Canada, involved a group of participants who engaged in moderate exercise three times a week for six weeks. At the end of the study, participants reported a 30% reduction in symptoms of depression compared to those who did not exercise. The researchers hope that these findings will encourage more people to incorporate regular exercise into their lives as a means of improving their mental health.</body>

         <text>A new study has found that sleep deprivation can impair decision making abilities, making it more difficult to weigh the pros and cons of different options.</text>
      </summary>
      <body>The study, conducted by researchers at a university in the United States, involved participants who were kept awake for 24 hours and then asked to make a series of decisions. The results showed that sleep-deprived participants were more likely to make impulsive decisions and had difficulty considering the long-term consequences of their choices. The researchers hope that these findings will encourage people to prioritize getting enough sleep, as sleep deprivation can have serious consequences for both mental and physical health.</body>

         <text>A new technology has been developed that allows for wireless charging of electronic devices, eliminating the need for cords and plugs.</text>
      </summary>
      <body>The technology, developed by a team of engineers at a tech company, uses magnetic resonance to wirelessly transfer power from a charging pad to a device, without the need for physical contact. The technology is expected to revolutionize the way people charge their electronic devices, making it more convenient and less cluttered. The engineers hope to roll out the technology to the market in the near future.</body>

         <text>A team of scientists has discovered a new species of deep-sea octopus, which they believe may have the ability to change its skin color and texture to camouflage itself in different environments.</text>
      </summary>
      <body>The octopus was discovered during a research expedition in the deep waters off the coast of New Zealand. It has been named "Opisthoteuthis adorabilis" due to its cute and playful appearance. The researchers are excited about the discovery, as the ability to change skin color and texture is rare among deep-sea creatures, and may provide new insights into how these animals adapt to their environment.</body>
