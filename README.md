# myreactapp

My First Single Page Application Using ReactJS!

This project is a simple web application that fetches the blogs from XML File and latest news articles from newsapi.org and displays them in a grid layout.

# Installation

To run this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. 

If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website.

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the zip file and extract it.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```npm install```

Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the application:

```npm start```

Finally, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

# API Key

To fetch news articles from newsapi.org, you need to have an API key. 

If you don't have one, you can get it by registering on their website.

Once you have your API key, open the Newsarticles.js file in the src directory and replace the API_KEY with your actual API key.

```https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=API_KEY&pageSize=5```

You should now be able to see the latest news articles in your web browser.
